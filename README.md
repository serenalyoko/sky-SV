Constructing_network.py
Make sure you store all your data files in one folder. 
This function assumes data files as csv, but you can change the file i/o lines if you are using other types of data files
The write function exports network data into csv. This is for in case if you need to use gephi for network visualization. 
We will add an pickle export funciton if needed.
